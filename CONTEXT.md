# CONTEXT.md — running log

This is the **log**: current state, decisions as they are made, and `§ Up Next`. Stable contracts
live in `CLAUDE.md`. If something here hardens into an invariant, move it there and note the move.

## Current state

**Provisioning 2 of 3 written and unit-tested, not yet run against the instance.** Phase 1
(Terraform) is defined but not applied; no `terraform apply` has run.

- `infra/provision/install_docker.py` installs Docker Engine and the Compose plugin at exact
  pinned versions (explicit `pkg=version` install strings, `apt-mark hold` after), via Docker's
  official repository — GPG key fetched to a temp file, content-validated, then dearmored into a
  repo-scoped keyring, never `apt-key add`. `infra/provision/discover_external_interface.py`
  identifies the default-route interface from `/proc/net/route`, never "isn't loopback," and
  writes it to `/etc/dws/external-interface` via its own boot-ordered
  `dws-external-interface.service` (`After=network-online.target`,
  `RemainAfterExit=yes`), so provisioning 3 reads a file instead of re-deriving the value. See
  `CLAUDE.md § 10`.
- `tests/provision/` — 27 tests green (15 from provisioning 1 plus 12 new). All 11 required
  mutation-table rows confirmed: each was performed, observed to turn the named test red, then
  restored. `conftest.py` extended with a `FakeCommandRunner` (an explicitly-injected `run`
  callable, not a global `subprocess.run` monkeypatch like provisioning 1's `StubRunner`, per this
  commit's spec) plus `fake_os_release` and `fake_proc_net_route` builders.
- `install_docker.py`'s real (non-dry-run) `install()` needed a way to avoid writing to the real
  `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list` during tests; added an internal `sources_list_path`
  parameter with no CLI flag (the interface deliberately doesn't expose one — the real destination
  is always the same fixed path) so tests can inject a tmp path while the real script keeps using
  the constant.
- CLI wiring verified end-to-end: `discover_external_interface.py` against a real fixture
  `/proc/net/route` tree (no subprocess calls at all — pure file I/O, so no stubbing needed);
  `install_docker.py` with stubbed `dpkg`/`curl`/`gpg`/`install`/`apt-get`/`apt-mark` on `PATH`,
  confirming the full command sequence and generated sources.list content, and confirming no real
  `/etc/apt` files were touched on this dev machine.
- **Doc placement judgment call, flagged here rather than silently applied:** the spec's Doc
  updates listed two Terraform-specific bullets (ASCII-only AWS string fields; `ignore_changes =
  [associate_public_ip_address]` on `aws_instance`) under the new `§ 10`. Given last commit's `§ 5`
  / `§ 9` split was exactly this failure shape — a Terraform-specific fact stated somewhere other
  than the Terraform section — they're recorded in `§ 8` (Terraform conventions) instead, and the
  canonical deploy path (`/opt/inland-waterway-signals`, per this commit's decision 9) extends the
  existing `§ 5` deploy-path bullet rather than adding a second, competing statement in `§ 10`.
  **Applied, outside this session:** commit `048fdcf` ("typoes in compute.tf and security.tf")
  landed between the provisioning-2 report and its commit, adding the `ignore_changes` lifecycle
  block to `compute.tf` and fixing the em-dash-to-hyphen `description`/comment strings in
  `compute.tf` and `security.tf` — the same two things `§ 8` now documents as contract. One
  side effect of that pass: a comment on `compute.tf`'s `metadata_options` block read `CLAUDE.md
  § a8` (a stray character from the em-dash cleanup); corrected back to `§ 8` in this commit.
- Docker install, once it runs on the instance, opens a **real, temporary, accepted risk window**:
  Docker inserts its own `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain with no restriction until provisioning 3
  populates it. Container traffic is not firewalled by anything this project controls during that
  window — only the security group, unaffected by any of this. Not a defect; schedule provisioning
  3 promptly rather than leaving a freshly-Dockerized instance unattended.
- `DOCKER-USER`/ufw and the Compose systemd unit are explicitly **not started** — provisioning 3.

- `infra/provision/mount_data_volume.py` identifies the data volume by AWS volume ID matched
  against the NVMe block-device serial (dash-stripped), formats it only if `blkid` reports no
  filesystem, and writes an idempotent, UUID-keyed `fstab` entry with `nofail`. See
  `CLAUDE.md § 9`.
- **Resolved:** the `§ 5` / `§ 9` split flagged in the previous report — `§ 5` said disks are
  identified via the NVMe controller path, `§ 9` said the code actually reads the block-device
  path — has been folded into a single statement in `§ 5` (block-device path, with the reasoning
  inline); `§ 9` now just points to `§ 5` instead of restating it. No more than one place says
  what the identification method is.
- `tests/provision/` (`pytest`, offline, no root/network/instance) — 15 tests green. All 12
  mutation-table rows confirmed: each was performed, observed to turn the named test red, then
  restored. Two fixture gaps were found and fixed during that process, not just the code: the
  zero-match fixture for "never returns a device on failure" had no non-root device for a
  topology-fallback bug to find, and the fstab fixture's root line was already in the exact
  single-space form a "rewrite from parsed fields" bug would reproduce — both let a real mutation
  pass green on the first attempt. Also fixed: a bare `from conftest import X` in the two later
  test files collided with `tests/terraform/conftest.py`'s own `conftest` module name when both
  suites run in one `pytest` invocation; resolved by exposing the shared test double as a fixture
  instead of an import, touching only `tests/provision/`.
- CLI wiring verified end-to-end under `--dry-run` with stubbed `blkid`/`mkfs.ext4`/`mount`/
  `findmnt` on `PATH` (this dev machine has no `blkid`, so this is as close to the real CLI path as
  is reachable off-instance): both the "already formatted" and "no filesystem yet" branches print
  the expected actions, fstab is untouched, and the mount point is not created.
- (At the time provisioning 1 landed: Docker install and interface discovery were not yet
  started. Both landed in provisioning 2, above; `DOCKER-USER`/ufw and the Compose systemd unit
  remain provisioning 3.)

- `CLAUDE.md` seeded with the contracts carried forward from the prior project (`Trade_Analysis_Project`).
- `.gitignore` committed, verified not self-excluding.
- `infra/terraform/` defines the full environment: purpose-built VPC + public subnet, a
  three-port ingress allowlist with mandatory egress, a separate `prevent_destroy`+encrypted EBS
  data volume, an EC2 instance with IMDSv2 required and a pinned AMI, a `prevent_destroy` EIP, and
  an SSM-only instance role. See `CLAUDE.md § 8`.
- `tests/terraform/` (`pytest`, offline, no AWS credentials/network/binary needed) — 15 tests
  green, and all 10 load-bearing decisions confirmed by mutation: each was reverted, the named
  test was observed to fail, then restored.
- `terraform init && terraform validate` succeed locally (AWS provider resolved to 5.100.0).
  `.terraform.lock.hcl` is committed and correctly not gitignored.
- **Re-verified from a fresh session:** `terraform plan` produces exactly 17 resource addresses,
  matching the spec (VPC, subnet, IGW, route table, route table association, security group, 3
  ingress rules, 1 egress rule, IAM role, instance profile, policy attachment, instance, EIP, EBS
  volume, `aws_volume_attachment.data`) — `test_data_volume_is_a_top_level_resource` asserts both
  the volume and the attachment exist, so the pairing is guarded. `test_ssh_ingress_cidr_is_a_variable_reference_not_a_literal`
  was re-mutated (port range widened to 0–65535): it fails on the `assert ssh_rules` not-found guard
  before touching `cidr_ipv4`, not on an unguarded lookup — confirmed not a vacuous pass.
  `.terraform.lock.hcl` was missing `h1:` hashes for any platform but the one that ran `init`
  (darwin_arm64); ran `terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64 -platform=darwin_arm64` and
  confirmed the file grew (one `h1:` hash → two). See `CLAUDE.md § 8`.
- Live-verified: `terraform plan` with a deliberately broad `ssh_admin_cidr` is rejected by the
  variable `validation` block (exit 1, no resources created). One correction to the plan as
  written: Terraform authenticates and prints the full resource-creation preview *before* raising
  the validation error, not before — see the Housekeeping note below.
- AWS budget alert: **not yet configured** — must exist before anything is provisioned.

## The thesis (one paragraph, so it stays in view)

River stage on the Mississippi system physically constrains how much grain a barge can carry, and
that constraint propagates into published barge freight rates within days. Water falls → draft
restrictions → light-loading and shorter tows → effective capacity drops while harvest volume does
not → rates rise → Gulf basis widens. Every arrow is mechanical, so a *broken* relationship is
informative rather than noise. Fast feature: 15-minute USGS gauge stage. Slow target: USDA's weekly
barge freight rate as percent of tariff. The 2022 and 2023 low-water events are labelled natural
experiments to validate against.

**Résumé framing that governs tradeoffs:** a real-time inland-waterway signal system on a single
corridor, where a fast-moving physical constraint leads a slow-moving published index, with honest
confidence gating that says "insufficient history" rather than manufacturing conviction.

## Key decisions

- **Data sources selected for cleanliness, not richness.** The prior project died on raw AIS: five
  distinct corruption mechanisms in arrival detection, 34.8% of stored arrivals with zero supporting
  position pings in the preceding six hours. Selection criterion here is data that arrives already
  clean and structured, from a publisher with an institutional obligation to keep publishing.
- **Full historical backfill on day one.** USGS from 2007-10-01, USDA Socrata with history. The prior
  project's later phases were gated on data accumulation; that gate does not exist here.
- **USACE LPMS routed around** — weekly lock movements come from USDA Table 10 instead. See
  `CLAUDE.md § 6`.
- **CBOT futures / Gulf basis is an extension, not the core.** Barge rate as percent of tariff is a
  legitimate target on its own.

---

## Open questions

- **Raw 15-minute gauge readings vs. hourly aggregates on ingest.** Must be decided before Phase 3.
  Size estimate: ~96 readings/day × ~6,880 days × ~15 sites × 2 params ≈ **20M rows** for the full
  raw backfill — roughly half the prior project's 38.5M, and this row is narrower. Hourly would be
  ~5M. Volume is not the deciding factor at this scale.
- **Whether USGS instantaneous-values requests can span the full period of record in one call.**
  Verify empirically in Phase 3 and chunk the backfill by date window if not. The plan currently
  assumes a single request; that assumption has not been tested.

## § Up Next

**Provisioning 3 — ufw with the admin-CIDR SSH rule, plus interface-scoped `DOCKER-USER` rules
reading `/etc/dws/external-interface`.** The lockout-risk commit; only start it after a human has
confirmed SSM Session Manager works on the instance (that's the recovery path if the boot sequence
goes wrong), and only after provisioning 2 has actually run — until then the instance is in the
accepted temporary risk window described in its commit report: Docker's own `DOCKER-USER` chain
exists with no restriction, and only the security group is firewalling anything.

A human needs to: configure the AWS budget alert; fill in real values in
`infra/terraform/terraform.tfvars` (region, AZ, `ssh_admin_cidr`, a verified current, region- and
architecture-matched Ubuntu 24.04 AMI ID — `terraform.tfvars` still does not exist, this is a human
decision and blocks `apply`); run `terraform apply`; then run provisioning 1
(`mount_data_volume.py`) and provisioning 2 (`install_docker.py`, `discover_external_interface.py`)
on the instance per the live-verification steps in their commit reports — provisioning 2's install
script needs real version strings from `apt-cache madison` first, the placeholder versions in its
report are not verified current values.

**Process note:** after any Claude Code session reports a commit, run `git log --oneline
origin/main` from your own terminal before treating the work as real — three separate sessions
today reported committed work that had not been pushed.

Then, in order: Phase 2 orchestration skeleton (migration runner, `job_runs`, `@job`, APScheduler with
persistent store, cadence table, heartbeat) **before the first ingest client**, so the first data that
ever lands is already observed. Phase 3 USGS ingest and backfill, including enabling TimescaleDB
compression and **measuring** the ratio — that measurement is what justifies TimescaleDB over a
managed database, and it must be a number taken here, not a vendor claim.

## Housekeeping — open, non-blocking

- AWS budget alert not yet configured. Blocks `terraform apply`.
- Domain not purchased. Blocks Phase 10 only.
- **State is local this commit.** No S3 backend, no state locking — that is explicitly out of
  scope for Phase 1. If `terraform.tfstate` is lost, `prevent_destroy` protects nothing, because
  Terraform no longer knows the data volume or the EIP exist. Do not treat local state as durable
  once anything has actually been applied.
